# Essential program pre-launch quality assurance process for success

If you are a [!DNL Marketo Engage] administrator or on the Marketing Operation team, reviewing the program configuration properly is crucial to avoid customer-facing mistakes. Though you can learn from your mistakes along the way to limit mistakes, it is not a scalable process. Learn how to design and run a program pre-launch quality assurance (QA) process between builders and power users/reviewers helps save you time, prevent errors, and train your internal users more quickly.

In this tutorial, you learn how a [!DNL Marketo Engage] administrator can develop a program pre-launch QA process to help your internal teams scale. The Program Pre-launch Checklist, sourced from [!DNL Adobe] Marketo Champion (2021), [Grace Brebner's blog post](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/champion-program-blogs/the-ultimate-go-live-checklist/ba-p/245759), is used as an example to walk you through the key elements and requirements.

## Why should you design a program pre-launch QA process?

If you are newer to [!DNL Marketo Engage], you may not know what to check for when building out a program. Even for seasonal [!DNL Marketo Engage] administers, reviewing the programs based on your memory is risky. This is when a program pre-launch checklist comes into play. It not only helps drive your program QA processes more smoothly, but also trains your builders to look out for common pitfalls.

* **Timesaving:** Without having an established QA process in place, it ultimately adds time to your program build process and take more time to take your marketing programs to the market. Once you set up your own program pre-launch list and have your internal users familiarize themselves with the QA process, they become more accurate in program configuration by using it.
* **Self-enablement:** Having your Marketing team go through the checklists that are relevant to the programs they are building provides a structured curriculum to train your internal users. Every time they work through the checklist to perform self-review, it builds up their muscle memory. Even if you are an experienced [!DNL Marketo Engage] administrator reviewing others' programs, having a checklist to check off prevents you from overlooking common pitfalls.

## Get started with designing your program prelaunch QA process.

### Step 1: Think through your QA process

Answer the following questions to think through your QA process:

* **Who is able to serve the reviewer and approver role?** 
    If you are in a smaller organization, the [!DNL Marketo Engage] admins may play hybrid roles of Marketing and Marketing Operations. It is recommended that you have a non-builder [!DNL Marketo Engage] Consider power users to audit the programs. A new pair of fresh eyes helps spot issues.

* **How would the builders and the reviewers collaborate and document notes and changes?** 
    You could keep things organized in a spreadsheet or within a project management platform. Reference the checklist below and convert the template into the format that works best for your organization. Your team can simply clone the template each time they build and review the program for launch.

### Step 2: Go through the program prelaunch

Go through the program prelaunch checklists line by line to familiarize yourself with the program QA scope.

**Rules of thumb to keep in mind:**

* This program pre-launch checklist isn't designed to be one size fits all. Use what's relevant, ignore or delete what's not, and customize it for your organization's needs. You could also divide up the checklists to use only pieces that are relevant to your program build.
* Define your requirements clearly. Consider your acceptance criteria for each element and edit them in your offline template.

### Step 3: Develop a guideline for your internal teams 

Develop a guideline for your internal teams to use the program prelaunch checklist and test run the QA process until it's more streamlined. 

Here's an example:

* Builders should clone the program prelaunch checklist to check, note, and approve as they go down the checklist.
* Have your builders do a self-review in one column and have the reviewers document their notes in another column next to the requirements.
* Only have the reviewers fill out the 'Final Checks' section. This section asks the reviewer to repeat several key checks to ensure that changes are made properly throughout the QA process.

### Step 4: Revisit the checklist on a regular basis

There may be items that are missing or not applicable as your team runs this exercise a few times. Revisit this checklist (for example, quarterly) to update the review items and acceptance criteria to fine-tune your program QA process.
