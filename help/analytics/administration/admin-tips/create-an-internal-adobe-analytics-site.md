# Create an internal Adobe Analytics site (Confluence or other)

**WHAT:** If you have heeded the recommendation in [this tip](create-basic-videos-and-training.md){target="_blank"} to create training docs, you obviously can't keep them on your hard drive. Create a central location where these can be shared and consulted by all your users - an internal Adobe Analytics site (Confluence or other) where you can post all these documents and maintain different versions.

**WHY:** Setting up a single shared repository will give you one place to direct all new users and offer a single source of truth in terms of the latest versions of all your docs. It allows for optimal version management and collaboration.

**HOW:** Here are some suggestions for sections of this internal site:

* _Intro_: How to get access, contacts, how to log in, how to create a JIRA ticket, where to get help, etc.
* _Tagging docs_: Property doc, tagging doc, code templates, etc.
* _Knowledge docs_: You can post naming conventions here, but also knowledge docs that have the same purpose as training videos. For example: how to track downloads, how to track coupons, etc.
* _Training docs_: Basic and advanced training sessions, short 5-10 minute videos. You can also provide links to Adobe resources: Experience League, YouTube channels, etc.
* _Admin docs_: SAINT files, JS files, knowledge docs on admin stuff like data feeds, etc.

I also recommend that you share the link to this site (and highlight the training section) in your "Welcome to Adobe Analytics" email when creating a new account.
