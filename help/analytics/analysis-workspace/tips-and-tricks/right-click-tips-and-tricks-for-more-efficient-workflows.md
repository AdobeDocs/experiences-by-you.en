Here are 7 right-click tips you can use in Analysis Workspace to make your workflows more efficient: 

## Tip #1: Adding Annotations on the Fly 

When you see a weird spike or a significant drop in Workspace, and you know what caused it: right-click on it and create an annotation.  

Within that annotation, you can limit it for only the specific project, or you can make it available to all your projects across the board. You can also give it a title, description, tag it, and even apply a color. Note that the annotation will be created for you automatically based on what you selected, but you can refine this further â€“ for example to a specific segment or dimension value only. 

This annotation will then show up on your visualizations and tables with all the info you provided. This will help to provide quick context to anyone viewing your report(s). All your annotations can be centrally managed under Components > Annotations  

## Tip #2: Trend Data for Funnels and Flow Reports 

Funnel (Fallout) reports are great at showing users going through multiple pages or events. But you can also trend that succession of events over time. You can easily do this by right-clicking on any level of the funnel and trending all touchpoints or a specific touchpoint into a line graph. You can do this by % or by the raw number of visits or visitors.  

You can also do this in Flow reports by right-clicking on a specific path and selecting 'Trend'.  

## Tip #3: Create Segments on the Fly - Faster & Easier  

You can also create a segment based on a Fallout report, Flow report, or from specific elements in a Freeform Table.  

Within a Fallout, right-click on any touchpoint, and select 'create segment from touchpoint' to quickly create a segment based on the succession of events or pages. This will instantly carry over all your logic, like multiple pages in a single level for example. Just name your segment and it will now show up under segments on the left rail. You can do the same for Flow reports by right clicking on a specific path and selecting 'create segment for this path' 

This also works for Freeform tables to create a quick shortcut, or to quickly create a segment with an 'or' statement. Select the rows you need in your table, right-click, and select 'Create segment from selection' 

These segments you created so easily are now ready for you to drop in a table, or to use as a filter for your report, or in any other way you want. 

## Tip #4: Create 'anchor links' within your report 

To bring users directly to a specific visualization, or table in your project, right-click at the top of it and select 'get visualization link'. This will bring users directly to that visualization and will also open it up if it is closed. This is especially useful for long projects where you can use this link at the top of your project like a table of contents or an anchor link. You can also use this link in an email for example, to bring somebody directly to a visualization within a larger project.  

## Tip #5: Editing labels in visualizations 

Renaming labels is a very simple tip but has so much value when it comes to spelling things out or saying them in a clear way that your team can more easily understand. Renaming labels help to simplify content and take up less space on your visualizations.  

This can be used in many visualizations, including line graphs, bar charts and fallouts 

## Tip #6: Downloading data for specific tables  

Users often want to export data to csv. This tip will help you get away from the 400-row limitation in Workspace. At the top of a Freeform Table, right-click and you will see 2 download options 

The 'Download items as CSV (Segments)' option will allow you to download up to 50,000 rows of data.  This will not carry any breakdowns you have over, but it will carry over all your segments and applied filters. This is very useful when there are thousands of rows of data. 

The 'Download data as CSV' option will only allow you to download up to 400 rows of data but will include breakdowns. 

## Tip #7: Hide Errors - Display only selected rows in a table 

It can make sense to hide certain rows in a Freeform Table. Select only the pertinent rows, right-click and select 'Display only selected rows'. Doing this will adjust your totals and % accordingly.  

This shouldn't be used to completely change your data, and you need to be careful not to hide important rows. But it can also be used as an easy way to clean up your data on the fly and to bring users attention back to the big picture. This is a great way to easily remove messy and insignificant details. 

I hope you make great use of these tips, and that they help you to save time and deliver more pertinent reports using [!DNL Adobe]'s Analysis Workspace!
